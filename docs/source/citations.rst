This type of vehicle and the mission environment poses challenges to the mission development as these operations contain many systems that must work together to ensure that the mission requirements are met and that the vehicle is operated safely. As such, a solution based on the SMACC library for Robotic Operating System (ROS) was proposed and tested using a simulator. The results shown were based on the simulation of three missions representative of different scenarios for a deep sea exploration AUV and they were evaluated on the completion of the mission plan. keywords: {Autonomous underwater vehicles;Robot kinematics;Roads;Operating systems;Oceans;Control systems;Libraries;AUV;mission control system;hierarchical finite state machines;mission coordination;ROS;SMACC},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9977228&isnumber=9976951
